# COVID impacts on stock market data analysis

## About this project

In this project, I am interested in whether COVID is one of the biggest factor that brought a huge negative impact on US stock market. 
However, it's impossible to include all the stock companies
and analyze their performance. Therefore, I decided to use two of the most representitve stock, SP500 and Dow Jones, to help analyzing US stock market performance.
